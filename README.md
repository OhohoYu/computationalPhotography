## First person hyperlapse video
The idea is to obtain an hyperlapse video from a first-person footage. This video from Microsoft explains the concept : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOpwHaQnRSY. The report is in the repository

## Creation of an heliotrope controllable video
Creation of a distance image between frames, creation of a graph incoding the distance, creation of an user interface to be able to choose the wanted path.
Computation of the shortest path to achieve the wanted movement, add synthetic frames between existing frames using the flows and compute a multi-node interpolation at the end to reach the wanted position
